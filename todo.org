- My notes about axelrod model and quick look at flache
  - cite:flache2017
  - cite:maciel2018emergencia
- I believe this paper is also useful cite:grofman1990efficient !
- [X] see [[file:notes/ephnotes/degrootreview.pdf]]

  - Particularly, what he has to say about tagging;

* DONE [#A] spell out my model ideas
See [[file:notes/15-06-21-grofman.org][last meeting notes]]


* DONE [#A] send email to grofman
SCHEDULED: <2021-07-07 qua>
Discuss the following points:
- The connection between the tag idea with cite:holland1996hidden mechanism of
  tag
- My idea about the path vs connection using some kind of decay factor
- Ask him about literature that could point out how to use institutions as molds
  of consensus/divergence

* DONE Code the model iteration procedures ( ongoing);
SCHEDULED: <2021-08-06 sex>
- Fix the pos stuff
- Fix

* TODO Anything radius related should use nearby_ids proc

* TODO write MWE of pos error

* TODO  Fix the anchor issue generator
* TODO Code the systemic variables to be collected while running the model;
* TODO Code an interactive widget to explore the model  (and generate an executable, if possible, to send to you);
* TODO Write unit*tests for potential bugs;
* TODO Optimize the code;
* TODO Code a sensitivity analysis.
