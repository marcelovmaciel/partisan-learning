- My notes about axelrod model and quick look at flache
  - cite:flache2017
  - cite:maciel2018emergencia
- I believe this paper is also useful cite:grofman1990efficient !
- [X] see [[file:notes/ephnotes/degrootreview.pdf]]
- [X] cite:holland1996hidden
  - Particularly, what he has to say about tagging;

* DONE [#A] spell out my model ideas
See [[file:notes/15-06-21-grofman.org][last meeting notes]]


* DONE [#A] send email to grofman
SCHEDULED: <2021-07-07 qua>
Discuss the following points:
- The connection between the tag idea with cite:holland1996hidden mechanism of
  tag
- My idea about the path vs connection using some kind of decay factor
- Ask him about literature that could point out how to use institutions as molds
  of consensus/divergence

* DONE Code the model iteration procedures ( ongoing);
SCHEDULED: <2021-08-06 sex>
- Fix the pos stuff
- Fix




* DONE write MWE of pos error

* DONE Write unit*tests for potential bugs;

* [X] Optimize the code;
* [X] Think about the consistency of the design

The last email got me thinking about the consistency of the design. The
primaries as they stand lead to party position not mattering since the candidate
selection is independent from the position of the party. This is a problem. On
the other hand if I reinstate the radius the size of the radius will probably be
the main factor... Or maybe not.

* DONE change voter party update
* DONE implement party position update!


* DONE Fix the initial condition to actually be ONLY an initial condition

* DONE Fix the incumbent behavior
-
* DONE fix the candidate choice sampler
- Simply filter before sampling!

* DONE Add \(\kappa\) as field for agents


* TODO [#B] REREAD [[cite:&aldrich1983downsian]]

* TODO [#B] Read analysis papers
- [X] [[cite:&siegel18_analy_comput_model]]
- [[cite:&lavin2021simulation]]
- [[cite:&borgonovo2022sensitivity]]

* DONE [#A] write down the model description
#+begin_quote
OK, let's skip for a while writing out a system of equations All I really need
is a clear statement in English with just enough math symbolism for me to be
sure of exactly how the different pieces of the model work. Then I'll worry
about describing the comparative statics in a non-formal way.
#+end_quote

* KILL plot the within party shares and prop people like me

* DONE implement the new distributional assumption;
- I'll simply put a constant in one dimension and work on the other lol.
- I'll use cohen d to define overlapping distributions:
  - As shown here [[https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/][Interpreting Cohen&#x27;s d | R Psychologist]] a cohen d of 1.35 gives an overlap of 50%.
- Thus if I have a distribution of (43,10) I gotta have the other as (56.5,10)

- OVL=2Φ(−∣δ∣/2)

* OKAY implement the new initial party id
* DONE implement visualization of party polarization




* TODO [#C] Create a representation gap incumbency advantage variant
 Right now the model is not presenting any interesting dynamics. Winning doesn't
 feedback into the system, nor the dissatisfaction of voters is taken into
 account. I'm thinking of coming up with possibly simpler model with death/birth dynamics

* DONE [#A] check if candidate sampling is correct in the hardwired example

* DONE [#A] Create time series for party loyalty colored by position, marker by party

* DONE [#A] implement turnout function
(6) make sure that the voting rule overweights those with stronger party ID; maybe you use a turnout function such that the stronger the party ID the more likely the voter is to vote in the primary. If it overweights those with stronger  party ID and those with stronger party are disproportionately extremists then, over time,  that should push the party nominations toward the extremes.

How I'll implement that:
- The subset of agents this function must work is party_supporters
- the proportion of times I've voted for this party will be the strength of my party identification;
  #+begin_src julia
  if rand() < strength_party_id
  return(my_id)
  end
  #+end_src
- Then I get for each party the supporters who will actually vote in this primary.



* DONE [#C] test initial vote

 The higher
the overlap between party distributions the more cross-party voting there should
be. If that's not true then there's something wrong. Try running the model with
different initial overlaps to see if the model does what it is supposed to do in
the initial round before we have party loyalties kicking in.

* DONE [#A] implement more concentrated distribution

* DONE [#B] Run small pipeline comparing the three distributions


* DONE [#A] Pick candidates from turnout voters

* TODO [#A] Write pipelines to test for those 3 expected behaviors!
  - Extremists must evolve to have stronger party ids;
  - Candidates Should Become more Extreme;
  - Those who turnout should be more extreme WITH TIME!;

* TODO [#A] *Weight party id* in defining party position;

* PROJ [#A] Redesign this
