- My notes about axelrod model and quick look at flache
  - cite:flache2017
  - cite:maciel2018emergencia
- I believe this paper is also useful cite:grofman1990efficient !
- [X] see [[file:notes/ephnotes/degrootreview.pdf]]
- [X] cite:holland1996hidden
  - Particularly, what he has to say about tagging;

* DONE [#A] spell out my model ideas
See [[file:notes/15-06-21-grofman.org][last meeting notes]]


* DONE [#A] send email to grofman
SCHEDULED: <2021-07-07 qua>
Discuss the following points:
- The connection between the tag idea with cite:holland1996hidden mechanism of
  tag
- My idea about the path vs connection using some kind of decay factor
- Ask him about literature that could point out how to use institutions as molds
  of consensus/divergence

* DONE Code the model iteration procedures ( ongoing);
SCHEDULED: <2021-08-06 sex>
- Fix the pos stuff
- Fix




* DONE write MWE of pos error

* DONE Write unit*tests for potential bugs;

* [X] Optimize the code;
* [X] Think about the consistency of the design

The last email got me thinking about the consistency of the design. The
primaries as they stand lead to party position not mattering since the candidate
selection is independent from the position of the party. This is a problem. On
the other hand if I reinstate the radius the size of the radius will probably be
the main factor... Or maybe not.

* DONE change voter party update
* DONE implement party position update!


* DONE Fix the initial condition to actually be ONLY an initial condition

* DONE Fix the incumbent behavior
-
* DONE fix the candidate choice sampler
- Simply filter before sampling!


* TODO Add \(\kappa\) as field for agents
